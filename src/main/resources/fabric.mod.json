  "description": "Combined PalorderSMP main + Kotlin beta mod.\n\nMain mod: PalorderSMP-Tweaked is a powerful server-side modification created by PalorderSoftWorksOfficial. It enhances server management and gameplay features while maintaining full compatibility with Minecraft 1.20.1. Future updates will include integration with popular mods like ComputerCraft to expand automation and scripting capabilities. Designed for stability, performance, and ease of use, this mod is ideal for both small and large server environments.\n\nKotlin beta mod: This is a kotlin beta build that requires fabric-language-kotlin! These builds are mostly unstable as these are included in the main jar for compatibility.",
